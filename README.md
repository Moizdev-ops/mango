## üèüÔ∏è Arena Duplication System

MangoParty features a powerful arena duplication system that allows for concurrent matches using the same arena design:

1. **How It Works**:
   - When all existing arenas are in use, the system automatically creates a new instance
   - The original arena's schematic is copied to a new location with proper offsets
   - All coordinates (spawn points, corners, center) are recalculated relative to the new center
   - The allowed kits configuration is preserved in the new instance

2. **Offset Configuration**:
   - Default X-axis offset: 200 blocks (configurable)
   - Default Z-axis offset: 0 blocks (configurable)
   - Each instance is numbered sequentially (e.g., arena1_instance1, arena1_instance2)

3. **Benefits**:
   - Unlimited concurrent matches using the same arena design
   - No need to manually create multiple copies of the same arena
   - Efficient use of server resources
   - Automatic cleanup when matches end

## üß© Technical Implementation

### **Game Mode Architecture**

#### **1. Duels System**
- **Core Classes**: `Duel.java`, `DuelManager.java`, `DuelListener.java`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Duels are managed through the `Duel` model class which tracks challenger, target, kit, rounds, and state
  - `DuelManager` handles duel creation, acceptance, and round management
  - `DuelListener` controls damage events, ensuring players can only damage opponents in the same duel
  - Round-based system with win tracking and automatic next round initialization
  - Player inventories are saved and restored using deep copy methods
  - Countdown system freezes players in place during preparation

#### **2. Party Split Matches**
- **Core Classes**: `Match.java`, `MatchManager.java`, `DuelListener.java`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses the `Match` model with a `playerTeams` map to track team assignments
  - Players are divided into Team 1 and Team 2 using the `assignTeams()` method
  - The `isPartySplitMatch` flag enables team-based damage control
  - `DuelListener` checks team affiliation before allowing damage between players
  - 5-second countdown with player movement restriction
  - Arena regeneration occurs after match completion

#### **3. Party FFA**

  - 5-second countdown with player movement restriction
  - Arena regeneration occurs after match completion

#### **4. Party vs Party**
- **Core Classes**: `Match.java`, `MatchManager.java`, `DuelListener.java`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Uses the `Match` model with the `assignPartyVsPartyTeams()` method
  - Challenge system with 60-second expiration timer
  - Team assignments based on party membership (Party 1 = Team 1, Party 2 = Team 2)
  - `DuelListener` checks team affiliation before allowing damage
  - 5-second countdown with player movement restriction
  - Arena regeneration occurs after match completion

#### **5. Queue System**
- **Core Classes**: `Queue.java`, `QueueManager.java`, `MatchManager.java`
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Queue entries stored with player/party information, kit selection, and queue time
  - Automatic matching based on queue duration and team size
  - Kit-specific queues to ensure balanced gameplay
  - Match creation when enough players/teams are available
  - Integration with the match system for actual gameplay

### **Common Components**
